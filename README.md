My name is Maroon, and I absolutely like to code! There's just something so fascinating and rewarding about being able to create something from scratch using nothing but my own skills and knowledge. Whether I'm working on a personal project or collaborating with others on a larger-scale application, the process of coding always manages to captivate me. And when it comes to my favorite coding subject, I have to say that NodeJS takes the cake. The possibilities for building all sorts of cool servers and other fun applications are truly endless, and the unique event-driven and non-blocking I/O model makes it super fast and efficient.
